# node-http-microservice

A simple Node.js microservice that exposes a simple function.

Optimized image that combines:

- `yarn` for build
- `pkg` for Node.js binaries
- `micro` as a lightweight HTTP server

for the highest build-time performance, smallest resulting artifact size
and fastest bootup time.
